# Curated Group Join

Curated Group Join (com.pawpawworks.civicrm.curatedgroupjoin) is an extension for
[CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org) which enables site admins to add to a form a
curated list of groups. While CiviCRM offers a "groups" profile field which can
be used to add group sign-up to most forms, the list cannot be curated; all
public groups are displayed.

Potential uses for this extension:

* On a membership sign-up form, allow members to select the member benefits to
  which they would like to opt-in. (Assumes opt-in is represented as group
  membership.)
* Allow users to sign up for email communications, or to join an interest group,
  without overwhelming them with the list of all public groups.
